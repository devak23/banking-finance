## Banking terms

#### _ACH (Automated Clearing House)_

It's a funds transfer system run by NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association). Its generally used by depository institutions such as banks. When you send money from one account to another, you can do it via bank wire or ACH. Think of ACH as an electronic payment from one bank account to another. The transaction is initiated by a business to debit an account by submitting an ACH file. This file contains the bank’s ABA (American Bankers Association®) number and the account number(s) to debit, along with the amount(s). This file is submitted for processing nightly and passes through networks controlled by the Federal Reserve. ACH payments are not guaranteed; that is, they must clear, much like a check. ACH is useful as an alternative to accepting a credit card.

#### _DDA_

DDAs, or demand deposit accounts, are offered by banks and credit unions. These accounts are primarily used for frequent transactions, such as checking accounts. However, the term "DDA account" refers to any bank account that you can deposit to and withdraw from immediately, on demand. DDA accounts may or may not pay interest. When they do, the rate is typically less than the rate found on certificates of deposit and other accounts. Most DDAs let you withdraw your money without advance notice, but the term also includes accounts that require six days or less of advance notice. DDA accounts permit joint account holders. Each holder can deposit and withdraw part or all of the balance at any time. Either can sign checks or make ATM withdrawals without the permission or knowledge of the other party. While both parties must submit signature cards to the bank to open DDA accounts, only one account owner is needed to close out the account. It's wise to open joint DDA accounts only with someone you trust.

#### _Transaction Accounts_

The term DDA is most often used to refer to transaction accounts, also called checking accounts. DDA accounts offer offer checks, ATM or debit cards and overdraft protection, if the account owner wishes. There are no restrictions on the number of withdrawals and deposits a user can have in given period. To attract more depositors, some banks offer interest for their DDA accounts, but many financial institutions still do not. For instance, Northeast Missouri State Bank offers some such accounts that pay interest, while the Bank of Ireland offers ones that do not.

#### _NOW and MMA Accounts_

NOW (negotiable order of withdrawal) accounts are essentially checking accounts where you earn interest on the money you have deposited. With a NOW account, the bank or credit union has the right to require at least seven days written notice of a withdrawal, though this is rarely done. Although NOW and MMA (money market accounts) allow deposits and withdrawals on a demand basis, they are not legally DDA accounts. These accounts typically pay market interest rates. MMA withdrawals are limited to six per month. Some banks might also limit your total MMA transactions to six per month, whether withdrawals, transfers or deposits. Bank fees apply if you exceed the transaction limits. The difference between a DDA (or checking account) and a negotiable order of withdrawal account is the amount of notice you need to give to the bank or credit union before making a withdrawal.

#### _WIRE transfer Vs ACH_

- :one: Wire transfers are guaranteed funds that occur on the same day provided the instructions are given to the originating bank before the cutoff time and sent by the originating bank to the Federal Reserve and received and processed by the receiving institution before close of their business day. Wires are not real time, they are normally same day.
- :two: Wires cost the bank $0.35 per wire and the bank typically retails them to customers for $6 in high volume to \$30 in very low volume. This covers the costs of labor, technology and compliance.

- :one:ACH is not same day, it is next (or can be future) day settlement. Transactions are entered with a date to settle which is normally the next day. At the opening of business banks receive files from the day before and process them, offsetting their general ledger with customer accounts. However because ACH debits are not guaranteed, the corresponding credit can be held. ACH credits are guaranteed and must be settled on the settlement day by the NACHA Rules.
- :two: ACH cost banks $0.035 per transaction or $0.025 per transaction in bulk (>1k transactions). They usually retail to customers for between $0.10 and $2.50, depending on volume. ACH by definition is meant to be automated, and meant to be delayed settlement, thus the lower cost associated. There is a push for real-time and same-day ACH service but large banks are fighting the push.
