#### _Book Value Per Share_ (BVPS)
Book value per common share (or simply Book value per share) is a method to calculate per share value based on common shareholder's equity in the company. In other words its the ratio of total assets in the company to the number of shares (except the preffered shares). In general, this is the value that you will get if the company is liquidated. Hence it is always preferable to buy a stock with a high book value.

Book value = [Total assets - intangible assets (patents, goodwill etc) - preffered equity] / total outstanding shares

Book value fails to take into account the intangible assets that may increase the market value of a share. For example, in software companies, the intangible assets are the intellectual property and the workforce which is not considered in the book value. The intangible assets are not reflected on the company's balance sheet.

#### _Earnings Per Share_ (EPS)
Earnings per share is basically "Profit per share". EPS is the ratio of the net income (minus the dividents paid on the preferred stock) to outstanding shares in the market

EPS = (Net income - dividents on preferred stock) / total outstanding shares

To choose a good share the EPS should have an increasing trend in the last 5 years

#### _Price to Earnings ratio_ (P/E)
Price to earnings ratio is a ratio of Market price of a share to the earnings per share and is given by the formula:

P/E = Market Price of the share / EPS

PE ratio shows how much an investor is willing to pay for a share per unit profit (1 Rupee profit per share). A high P/E ratio could mean that the share is overvalued. It is generally prefered that P/E ratio is lower when compared with companies in the same sector

#### _Price to Book ratio_ (P/B)
Price to book ratio is given by the formula:

P/B = Market Price of the share/ Book value per share (BVPS)

What it tries to do is to find out how much is the market evaluating the stock compared to the underlying asset. For example: if a stock has a market price of 20 rupees and the BVPS of 10 (10 lakhs asset value and 1 lakh shares, then BVPS = 1,000,000/100,000 = 10), then P/B = 20/10 = 2. 

So a P/B ratio of 2 means: 1 share of that company costs twice as much as its assets if it were sold. In other words, a P/B ratio is an indication of how much shareholders are paying for the net assets a of a company. A high P/B ratio indicates that investors/market thinks that the company has growth potential. A P/B ratio of 2 is low in practical cases, but some stock trade below their book value

The price to bookvalue ratio should be lower when compared to companies in the same sector.

#### _Book to Market ratio_ (B/M)
The book to market ratio is simply the inverse of P/B. Formula:

B/M = Book Value per share / Market value per share OR
B/M = Book Value / Market Cap

If the ratio is below 1, then he stock is overvalued. Conversely, if the ratio is more than 1, then the stock is considered undervalued. Lets say a video game company A has a book value of 600 million (60 crores), but the market capitalization (or maket value of all the outstanding shares times the price of a single share) is 800 million (80 crores), then B/M = 600/800 = 0.75 and indicates that the stock may be overvalued. B/M ratio does not take into consideration the intangible assets of the company.
